## 1. Introduction üí°
Real estate markets are constantly evolving, and are an interest of potential homeowners, investors, real-estate agents, and city planners. Property values are influenced by a variety of factors and grasping their relative importance is key to understanding future pricing trends. However, the market‚Äôs complexity can present significant challenges in making accurate predictions. Developing a reliable prediction model is essential for understanding these trends, enabling better decision-making for relevant parties.

In this project, we take a look at recent real estate trends in the city of Toronto. In considering the relationships between real estate prices and factors like location, amenities, etc. we seek to inform future predictions about the quality and pricing of housing in downtown Toronto. This information could contribute to more informed investment, home buying, selling, and city planning. The information uncovered in this investigation could also be relevant in highlighting discrepancies between housing prices and income in Toronto, thus informing the need for more affordable housing or rent control.

## 2. Our Dataset üë©‚Äçüíª
### 2.1 Description
This dataset is a simulated representation of the Toronto real estate market, designed to reflect condo sales prices listed on the Multiple Listing Service. It focuses specifically on Toronto‚Äôs downtown core, covering three wards as defined by the City of Toronto (Wards 10, 11, and 13). The data have been curated to closely resemble real-world trends and variable relationships, enabling meaningful analysis.

### 2.3 Preprocessing Steps

### 2.4 Justification
Our dataset has 3042 entries of different residential buildings across three wards in Toronto (Spadina-Fort York, University-Rosedale, and Toronto Centre). Each entry includes information about building amenities, location, age, and price. The dataset can thus be used to examine how price varies according to such factors. Further study can be conducted by cross-referncing each building with more information about its ward's demographic, which can be found [here](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/neighbourhoods-communities/ward-profiles/).
