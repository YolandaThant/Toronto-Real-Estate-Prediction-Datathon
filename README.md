## Introduction
Real estate markets are constantly evolving, and are an interest of potential homeowners, investors, real-estate agents, and city planners. Property values are influenced by a variety of factors and grasping their relative importance is key to understanding future pricing trends. However, the marketâ€™s complexity can present significant challenges in making accurate predictions. Developing a reliable prediction model is essential for understanding these trends, enabling better decision-making for relevant parties.

In this project, we take a look at recent real estate trends in the city of Toronto. In considering the relationships between real estate prices and factors like location, amenities, etc. we seek to inform future predictions about the quality and pricing of housing in downtown Toronto. This information could contribute to more informed investment, home buying, selling, and city planning. The information uncovered in this investigation could also be relevant in highlighting discrepancies between housing prices and income in Toronto, thus informing the need for more affordable housing or rent control.
