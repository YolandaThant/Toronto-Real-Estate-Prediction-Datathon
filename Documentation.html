<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction üí°</h2>
<p>Real estate markets are constantly evolving, and are an interest of
potential homeowners, investors, real-estate agents, and city planners.
Property values are influenced by a variety of factors and grasping
their relative importance is key to understanding future pricing trends.
However, the market‚Äôs complexity can present significant challenges in
making accurate predictions. Developing a reliable prediction model is
essential for understanding these trends, enabling better
decision-making for relevant parties.</p>
<p>In this project, we take a look at recent real estate trends in the
city of Toronto. In considering the relationships between real estate
prices and factors like location, amenities, etc. we seek to inform
future predictions about the quality and pricing of housing in downtown
Toronto. This information could contribute to more informed investment,
home buying, selling, and city planning. The information uncovered in
this investigation could also be relevant in highlighting discrepancies
between housing prices and income in Toronto, thus informing the need
for more affordable housing or rent control.</p>
<h2 id="our-dataset">2. Our Dataset üë©‚Äçüíª</h2>
<h3 id="description">2.1 Description</h3>
<p>This dataset is a simulated representation of the Toronto real estate
market, designed to reflect condo sales prices listed on the Multiple
Listing Service. It focuses specifically on Toronto‚Äôs downtown core,
covering three wards as defined by the City of Toronto (Wards 10, 11,
and 13). The data have been curated to closely resemble real-world
trends and variable relationships, enabling meaningful analysis. Please

<h3 id="preprocessing-steps">2.3 Preprocessing Steps</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>In our analysis, the most important factor we are considering is the
<strong>size</strong> (square footage) of building units. We therefore
removed all entries where size was <em>NA</em>.</li>
<li>Size was given in ranges of 500 square feet and as string values. We
took the median value for each range and converted to integers.
<ul>
<li><strong>e.g.¬†‚Äú1500-1999 sqft‚Äù becomes 1750.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Some entries did not have prices provided. We removed those
entries.</li>
<li>Of the entries that did provide prices, we divided all values by
1000 to increase readability.</li>
</ol>
<p>After processing, we were left with 2870 entries.</p>
<h3 id="justification">2.4 Justification</h3>
<p>Our dataset has 3042 entries of different residential buildings
across three wards in Toronto (Spadina-Fort York, University-Rosedale,
and Toronto Centre). Each entry includes information about building
amenities, location, age, and price. The dataset can thus be used to
examine how price varies according to such factors. Further study can be
conducted by cross-referncing each building with more information about
its ward‚Äôs demographic, which can be found <a
href="https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/neighbourhoods-communities/ward-profiles/">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="exploratory-data-analysis-and-initial-findings">3. Exploratory
Data Analysis and Initial Findings üîç</h2>
<p>Ultimately, we are interested in studying the prices of real estate
units across Toronto. Let‚Äôs take a look at the price distribution of
buildings in our data set.</p>
<p>We can use Python to compute some quick summary statistics:</p>
<pre><code># Load data
df = pd.read_csv(&quot;./cleaned_real_estate_data.csv&quot;)

# Summarize data 
prices = df[&#39;price (In 1000s)&#39;]
summary = prices.describe()
print(summary)

&gt;&gt;&gt; count    2928.000000
&gt;&gt;&gt; mean      894.598702
&gt;&gt;&gt; std       560.099359
&gt;&gt;&gt; min       298.000000
&gt;&gt;&gt; 25%       551.000000
&gt;&gt;&gt; 50%       717.500000
&gt;&gt;&gt; 75%      1012.250000
&gt;&gt;&gt; max      5688.000000</code></pre>
<p>From this information, it seems the average property has a list price
of $894k. However, it is important to observe that the range of our data
is $5,390k. This is an <em>incredible</em> amount of variation,
especially with regards to the IQR of $461.25k. Looking at our minimum
and maximum values, it seems like our data may be right-skewed. To
confirm this, we have to take a look at the distribution
graphically.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./price_density.png"/>
<figcaption>
<strong>Fig. 1:</strong> Density histogram of price (in thousands of
CAD).
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>From this figure, we confirm that the price distribution is
right-skewed. Moreover, we see that the majority of real estate
properties have a price that falls within the range of $250,000 -
$1,000,000. From this information, we can conclude that our previous
sample mean may not be robust enough to reflect the actual mean property
value.</p>
<p>We had previously obtained a median list price of $717k. Comparing
this to the <a
href="https://trreb.ca/market-data/condo-market-report/">2024‚Äôs Q4
average condo sale price</a> in Toronto, $689,198, we see that our
median is a much closer approximation to this.</p>
<p>For some extra investigation, let‚Äôs see if the distribution of prices
varies across the 3 neighborhoods (wards) we examine.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./ward_vs_price.png"/>
<figcaption>
<strong>Fig. 2:</strong> Ward vs.¬†price (in 1000s of CAD)
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It seems that real estate prices are distributed similarly across the
three wards. University-Rosedale (on average) has the most expensive
units, while Spadina-Fort York encompasses the unit with the highest
list price. But overall, there is little discernable difference between
them.</p>
<h2 id="visualizations">4. Visualizations üìä</h2>
For the visualization of the price against the size of an aprtment, we
decided to use a joint plot to clearly see the relationship between the
two variables while also seeing the marginal distributions. The joint
plot is displayed below:
<figure>
<img src="./joint_plot.png"/>
<figcaption>
<strong>Fig. 3:</strong> Size vs.¬†price (in 1000s of CAD)
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The joint plot shows a strong, positive linear association between
the size of the house and the price which makes sense as the price is
likely to be higher for a bigger house. It can be seen through the
figure that as the size of the apartment increases, the data points seem
to gradually grow apart suggesting that for apartments that are bigger
in size, the prices are more variable compared to smaller apartments
whose prices are more similar. A possible analysis for the variable
prices could be due to the neighbourhood that the apartments are in or
the amenities provided.</p>
<p>The marginal distribution also provide insights into the individual
variables. The sizes of the houses show a right skewed distributions
suggesting that many of the houses have smaller sizes with an average of
589 square feet, this would mean that most the apartments are within the
range of 500-999 which is accurate as Toronto mostly has skyscrappers
thereby the explaining the right skewed distribution.</p>
<p>The correlation coefficient <strong>r ‚âà 0.877</strong> suggests a
strong positive association between house size and price. Since house
prices generally increase with size. However, some variability
<strong>(23%)</strong> remains unexplained, which could be due to
factors like location, amenities, market trends, or other
influences.</p>
To visualize the price versus the number of bedrooms in a unit, we
utilized a box plot to effectively compare price distributionds across
different unit types. The box plot allows us to clearly observe the
spread of prices, detect outliers, and identify trends in price
variability across bedroom categories. By using this visualization, we
can see how price distributions differ between 0, 1, 2, and 3-bedroom
apartments while also highlighting the presence of extreme values. The
box plot is displayed below:
<figure>
<img src="./price_vs_room.png"/>
<figcaption>
<strong>Fig. 4:</strong> Rooms vs.¬†price (in 1000s of CAD)
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As expected, apartments with more bedrooms generally have higher
prices, but the spread of prices also increases with the number of
bedrooms. The variability in prices is particularly notable for two and
three-bedroom apartments. This suggests a wider range of factors
influencing pricing, such as location, amenities, or unit size.
One-bedroom and studio apartments exhibit a more compact price
distribution, indicating that prices for smaller units tend to be more
consistent. The presence of outliers, especially for larger apartments,
highlights high-end listings that significantly exceed the typical price
range. The right-skewed distribution aligns with market trends in
Toronto, where luxury units and penthouses drive up the upper end of the
pricing spectrum.</p>
<h2 id="our-model">5. Our Model ‚ö°Ô∏è</h2>
<p>In order to be able to predict the values, we decicded to use the
linear regression model. The linear regression model we found is:
price_hat = 0.80 * size + 208.81. This suggests that for every square
foot of size, the price increases by CAD 800.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./residual_plot.png"/>
<figcaption>
<strong>Fig. 1:</strong> Residual Plot for Prediction vs Housing Prices
(In Thousands CAD).
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>From the underlying residual plot, although the variance (vertical
spread) increases as the fitted values (predicted values) increase,
there appears to be no convex or concave curve shape in this plot. This
indicates the points are (sort of) randomly spread out, and that a
linear regression model does a good job of fitting the data. With that
being said, a possible reason to why the variance (vertical spread)
increases is because of the way <strong>the dataset was given to
us</strong>: size of housing was in intervals. Thus, we decided to pick
a size from the interval, which is by the median of each interval.</p>
<h2 id="results">6. Results ‚ùóÔ∏è</h2>
<p>We also split the dataset into 80% training data and 20% testing data
to see check if the model predicts the prices correctly. However becasue
we have divided our size as the median of the different intervals, the
prices for a particular size is variable resulting in large differences
betweent he actual and predicted values and in fact this is also the
reason for repeated predicted values as shows below Predicted values vs
Actual values: Predicted: 808.94, Actual: 930.00 Predicted: 1209.55,
Actual: 875.00 Predicted: 808.94, Actual: 594.00 Predicted: 808.94,
Actual: 1143.00 Predicted: 1209.55, Actual: 904.00 Predicted: 1209.55,
Actual: 1259.00 Predicted: 408.32, Actual: 429.00 Predicted: 1209.55,
Actual: 967.00 Predicted: 808.94, Actual: 573.00 Predicted: 1209.55,
Actual: 679.00 Predicted: 808.94, Actual: 611.00 Predicted: 808.94,
Actual: 749.00 Mean Squared Error (MSE): 64765.69 =&gt; RMSE = 254.5</p>
<p>The RMSE is also higher due to the way of the dataset was provded and
choosing of the sizes in each interval.</p>
<h2 id="discussion">7. Discussion üó£Ô∏è</h2>
<p>It is no secret that Toronto residents are facing down a massive
housing crisis. According to a <a
href="https://www.torontomu.ca/content/dam/social-innovation/Programs/Affordable_Housing_Visual_Systems_Map_Oxford.pdf">TMU
study</a>, the demand for Social housing has increased 68% since 2007,
while the amount available has remained largely unchanged. Through our
investigation, we have highlighted the incredible diversity of prices
real estate properties. And yet, it is obvious that most units skew to
the more expensive end. For those struggling to find housing, the
question thus remains: what can be done? Has the gentrification of
Toronto‚Äôs neighborhoods gone too far?</p>
<p>Other parties that may be interested in trends in real estate prices
may include investors, government bodies, and home owners. With regards
to investors, there is the expected trend that larger units with more
bedrooms are more valuable. However, it is important to consider whether
the prohibitive cost of some of these larger units may make selling them
more difficult. This information is also pertinent for home buyers, who
can use it to investigate what kinds of units are in their price
range.</p>
<p>The information about how prices vary across neighborhoods may be
useful for the government. They can determine property tax rates for
housing based on the projected valuation of real estate properties by
neighborhood.</p>
<p>The densely packed vertical clusters suggests varying prices for the
same size indicating the influence of other variables such as location,
age of property etc. Businesses and investors can use this information
to price properties competitively based on market trends. They could
target different customer segments based on these price patterns such as
the central 50% of the price is in the range 551000 to 1681000 CAD which
is the main market segment. The varying price can also be indicative of
a volatile market suggesting that investors should analyze whether these
outliers are justifies by other property features before moving forward.
Some of the high-price outliers indicate luxury properties which could
be potential negotiation oppurtunities.</p>
